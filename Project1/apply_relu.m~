% This function take an input array of size N x M x D and outputs an array
% of the same size.
% The purpose of the rectified linear unit is to act as a thresholding
% operation that sets any negative pixel values to become 0 in the output
% array.
% Formula: Out(i, j, k) = max(In(i, j, k), 0)
function result = apply_relu(image)

    % Establish row, column, and color channel size.
