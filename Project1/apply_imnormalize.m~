% This function will take an input color image (3 dimensional array of size
% N x M x 3) and output the array of the same size.
% Specifically, this will apply a scale to each color channel's pixel
% values into the output range -0.5 to 0.5.
% Formula: Out(i, j, k) = In(i, j, k) / 255.0 - 0.5
%
% This is a straightforward operation, but the matrix must be converted to
% a double to allow negative values since it's initially a unsigned 8 bit
% integer
function result = apply_imnormalize(image)
    result = image;
